      <p>
        At New Horizons, our mission is to empower asylum seekers, refugees, and vulnerable
        communities by providing essential support, opportunities for growth, and the compassion
        they need to rebuild their lives. We believe every individual deserves access to safety,
        education, healthcare, and a pathway to a better future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded in 2025 as a community initiative, New Horizons has grown into a respected
        organization dedicated to creating change. Over the years, we have built a strong network of
        volunteers, partners, and supporters who work together to ensure that refugees not only find
        shelter, food, and financial assistance, but also acquire the tools they need for long-term
        self-reliance.
